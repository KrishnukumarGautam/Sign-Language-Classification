Got it 👍 I’ll build you a professional, clean, and detailed README.md file for your Sign Language Recognition Project. You can directly use this on GitHub or anywhere else.

🖐️ Sign Language Recognition using CNN

A deep learning project that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Sign Language MNIST Dataset.

📌 Final model achieved 93.35% accuracy on the test dataset.
📌 Supports 25 unique sign classes (A–Z excluding J and Z).
📌 Provides Top-3 predictions with confidence scores for better real-world reliability.

📂 Dataset

Dataset: Sign Language MNIST (Kaggle)

Contains 27,455 training images and 7,172 testing images

Each image: 28x28 grayscale hand gesture

Labels: 0–24, representing A–Z (except J and Z)
